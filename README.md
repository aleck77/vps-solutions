# Next.js Project with Firebase Studio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and configured for use with Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified by your development environment, e.g., the port provided by Firebase Studio's IDX preview) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
