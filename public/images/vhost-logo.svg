  <desc>Abstract VH logo. The letter V's left leg in dark blue. The letter H's left leg (conceptually V's right leg) in light blue, H's right leg, and H's crossbar also in light blue. H's legs are tilted, and crossbar ends are parallel to H's legs.</desc>

  <!--
    Vertices calculated to maintain thickness 5, be centered at y=30,
    and have ends parallel to H's legs with a small gap.
    H's left leg centerline at y=30 is x=31.5.
    H's right leg centerline at y=30 is x=43.5.
    Gap for crossbar from leg strokes, approx 1.5 units from stroke edge.
    Stroke edge is ~2.5 units from centerline. Total shift ~4 units from centerline.
    P_L_center_on_crossbar = (31.5, 30)
    P_R_center_on_crossbar = (43.5, 30)
    Shift for gap (horizontal component): 3 (approx value for visual gap)
    x_start_parallelogram_top = 31.5 - (11/40)*(27.5-30) + 3 = 31.5 - (11/40)*(-2.5) + 3 = 31.5 + 0.6875 + 3 = 35.1875
    x_start_parallelogram_bottom = 31.5 - (11/40)*(32.5-30) + 3 = 31.5 - (11/40)*(2.5) + 3 = 31.5 - 0.6875 + 3 = 33.8125

    x_end_parallelogram_top = 43.5 - (11/40)*(27.5-30) - 3 = 43.5 + 0.6875 - 3 = 41.1875
    x_end_parallelogram_bottom = 43.5 - (11/40)*(32.5-30) - 3 = 43.5 - 0.6875 - 3 = 39.8125
